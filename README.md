# garfields-groceries
## Challenge
We have invented a new shopping cart for our online grocery store that uses your purchasing habits to recommend products for you. Design a layout that displays the customer's top products and allows the user to choose the quantity they'd like to purchase. There should also be a total amount that sums up the total value of your purchase in real time.

**Bonus:** Use a predictable state container such as redux or flux.

## Installation
To install you'll probably want [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (although npm should work just fine).
Simply run `yarn` on this directory to install all the necessary packages.

### Up and Running
To build the site, you can run `yarn build` (or if you want to make changes, run `yarn watch`).
Then, simply open `index.html` in a browser.

### Tests
Coming soon...
